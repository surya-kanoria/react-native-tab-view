# React Native Tab View

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/reactnativetabview.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactnativetabview)

This is the fork of https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view. It contains changes to make it work with older versions of ReactNative. (~0.30.0 and below)

If you are on the latest react-native version, use https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view for npm installation.

## Changes:

* Since flexGrow, flexShrink properties were not a part of older version of react-native, it has been replaced with flex
* I18nManager removed.

The usage remains the same. Please refere to https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view/blob/master/README.md for detailed guidance.
